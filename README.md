# Introduction

We are giving you an incomplete game which you need to "finish". Please complete as many tasks as you can. Think, which tasks are easier to finish and do them first.

## Tasks

1. Make the ball move
2. Make the ball bounce of the walls (2 steps needed)
3. Make the paddle move with keys (paddle cannot pass through walls)
4. Blocks disappear when ball hits them
5. When ball flies through bottom, display message "Game Over". You can either show this on UI or just log it into console.

Good luck!
