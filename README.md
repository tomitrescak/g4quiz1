# Introduction

We are giving you an incomplete game which you need to "finish". Please complete as many tasks as you can. Think, which tasks are easier to finish and do them first.

## Practice Tasks

1. Make the paddle move with keys (paddle cannot pass through walls)
2. Blue blocks disappear when ball hits them
3. When blocks disappear an explosion animation is shown. The explosion is already part of your animator.
4. Red blocks disappear after two hits. Show the "RedBreak" animation after first hit. This animation is already part of the animator.
5. When ball flies through bottom, display message "Game Over". You can either show this on UI or just log it into console.

Good luck!
